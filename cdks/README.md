# Cloud Development Kits (CDKs)

Cloud Development Kits allow you to develop your cloud infrastructure in coding languages you're already familiar with (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#/.Net, etc).
They are frameworks inside those other languages to create classes/objects and the tools to convert those into real cloud infrastructure. It follows the same end goal as other infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform,
but goes about it a different way.
